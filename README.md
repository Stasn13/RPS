## Areas for Improvement
We are very appreciate your pull requests. Do not hesistate to make your contributions.

Areas for improvement:
- Current contract has specific functionality, on j1 timeout j2 can withdraw stakes of both players. To prevent this would be nice to implement auto-submit for j1 if this player away from keyboard.
- Implement React Context state to avoid props drilling.
- Cover by unit-tests
- Fluent design(add toasts, transitions, color scheme and etc)
